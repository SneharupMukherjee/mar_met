## Core signal
- Spend rose +22% week-over-week while first meaningful participation remained statistically flat.
- Largest conversion leakage appears between landing-page load and wallet connect completion.

## Decision block
- **What changed:** Prospecting budget increased and broader placements were added.
- **Likely why:** Incremental traffic quality declined; landing friction amplified weak intent.
- **What to do next:** Reallocate spend toward high-intent segments and test simplified connect flow.
- **Tradeoffs/confidence:** Medium confidence; short-term reach may fall while efficiency improves.
