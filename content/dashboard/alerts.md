# Alert Cards

> [!WARNING]
> **Synthetic-data disclaimer (persistent):** All figures, trends, and narratives on this dashboard are generated from synthetic data for demonstration and planning. Do **not** treat values as live performance or financial reporting.

## 1) Spend up with flat participation
- **Trigger logic:** Spend +15%+ over trailing 7 days AND participation change within ±3%.
- **Interpretation:** Efficiency dilution or funnel leakage likely.
- **Action:** Freeze incremental prospecting budget; inspect funnel-step conversion deltas.

## 2) Meta fatigue by angle
- **Trigger logic:** Meta CTR down 20%+ and CPM up 10%+ for a creative angle over 5-day window.
- **Interpretation:** Audience saturation or creative wear-out by message angle.
- **Action:** Rotate net-new angle variants; lower frequency cap for fatigued cohorts.

## 3) Non-brand search CPC pressure / rank-budget lost share
- **Trigger logic:** Non-brand CPC +18%+ with impression-share loss due to rank or budget constraints.
- **Interpretation:** Auction competitiveness increased and/or bidding constraints too tight.
- **Action:** Split high-intent terms, rebalance bids, and protect priority keyword coverage.

## 4) Tracking break suspected on date
- **Trigger logic:** Event volume discontinuity >35% day-over-day with stable spend/clicks.
- **Detected date:** **2026-01-14**.
- **Interpretation:** Instrumentation failure more likely than real behavior shift.
- **Action:** Escalate war-room incident, validate tags, and initiate data backfill workflow.
