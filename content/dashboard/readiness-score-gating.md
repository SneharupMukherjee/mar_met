## Core signal
- Score threshold moved from 0.55 to 0.68.
- Eligible audience volume fell, but quality proxies improved.

## Decision block
- **What changed:** Stricter gating routed only higher-scoring users to conversion-oriented paths.
- **Likely why:** High-scoring users carry stronger near-term intent and lower bounce propensity.
- **What to do next:** Tune threshold by channel; introduce soft-gate nurture path for near-threshold cohorts.
- **Tradeoffs/confidence:** High confidence on quality lift, medium confidence on total-volume recovery.
