## Core signal
- Stage progression now follows message sequence: reminder → validation proof → conversion ask.
- Completion from stage 1 to stage 3 improved versus prior single-shot retargeting.

## Decision block
- **What changed:** Campaign architecture shifted to staged retargeting with creative rotation by intent depth.
- **Likely why:** Better message sequencing reduced cognitive load and improved relevance timing.
- **What to do next:** Cap frequency by stage and expand proof-oriented variants for underperforming angles.
- **Tradeoffs/confidence:** Medium-high confidence; increased operational complexity for creative ops.
