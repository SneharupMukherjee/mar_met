## Core signal
- D1 return proxy and repeated action rate improved in gated + staged cohorts.
- Low-quality participation markers declined after architecture updates.

## Decision block
- **What changed:** Combined readiness gating and staged retargeting were maintained through post-TGE period.
- **Likely why:** Higher-intent acquisition and better sequence fit improved user quality mix.
- **What to do next:** Extend holdout tests for causal confidence and calibrate bid strategy to retention-weighted KPIs.
- **Tradeoffs/confidence:** Medium confidence due to proxy metrics; causal certainty requires longer holdout windows.
